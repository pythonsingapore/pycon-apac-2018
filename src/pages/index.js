            developers to build and deploy complex event-driven web applications
            to AWS Lambda, allowing for infinite elasticity and massively
            reduced operations burdens. Zappa is now used in production by
            thousands of top companies all around the world, helping them save
            millions of dollars on operations costs.

            architect and software developer at the Childhood Cancer Data Lab,
            where he was responsible for the architecture, application
            development and operations of a system which processed petabytes of
            genetic data in order to accelerate the the use of artificial
            intelligence in the hunt for cures of rare cancers.
